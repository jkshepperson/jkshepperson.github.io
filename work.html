						<div class="hide-some show-text">
							<p class="centertext">To help, we gave the WYSIWYG a face-lift and restructured some of the business logic to make the email content entry process faster and easier to use by creating a ‘Tools’ area within the WYSIWYG. This allowed the users fast access to the information theys need all in one-place. We added custom logic to help non-code-savvy users with the HTML markup while not inhibiting workflow.</p>

							<p class="centertext"><span class="result">Result:</span> improved WYSIWG for content entry in our custom made CMS that integrated seamlessly into our eCommerce, CRM and marketing systems.</p>

My design strategy brought the customer experience to the forefront of their system interaction and allowed them more flexibility to create the structure of creative pages and emails in a way that met their marketing demands.</p>

Making adjustment to the UI process of tagging, assigning and reviewing testing group data helped to alleviate workflow headaches and increase the collaboration and visibility of the marketing tests company wide.</p>
