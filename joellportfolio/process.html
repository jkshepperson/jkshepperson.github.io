					<h4 class="location">Agora Inc. 2015</h4>
						
						<p class="centertext">In 2015, our sales teams expressed the need for a new dashboard to track and update their call metrics and daily lists. Poor visibility into call metrics was leading to poor call volume, duplicated work and loss of revenue...</p>

						<div class="centertext"><a href="#" id="showmore">Show More</a></div>

						<p class="hide centertext" id="show-on-click">To begin, I created and published a survey to 10 randomly selected participants, reflecting the ratio of our inbound and outbound sales teams. The goal was simple: understand their critical tasks, goals, frustrations and shortcuts to help us find the roots of the roadblocks.</p>

						<p class="hide centertext" id="show-on-click">Below is an example of an infographic I made to highlight the results of the survey for a board meeting with our CRM stakeholders.</p>

					<h4 class="location">Agora Inc. 2015</h4>

						<p class="centertext">Understanding the roots of our telesales team frustrations was only the beginning of helping us understand a very niche and critical role in our organization...</p>

						<p class="hide centertext" id="show-on-click">Creating personas allowed us to start with the ocean, and hone in on a beach. By conducting group interviews as well as participating in shadow-sessions, we were able to identify two very unique personas for our core user group.</p>

						<p class="hide centertext" id="show-on-click">This persona document is an example of one presented to our C-level executives to help them understand more individual needs of our particular teams to help guide our project direction and scope.</p>

				<h3 class="projecttitle">Mental Model</h3>
					<h4 class="location">Agora Inc. 2015</h4>

						<p class="centertext">During the development, I realized that our team needed more clarity on the most tedious and duplicative tasks being performed daily by our sales team...</p>

						<div class="centertext"><a href="#" id="showmore">Show More</a></div>

						<p class="hide centertext" id="show-on-click">Reviewing old research notes, making some quick phone calls and walking-through the tasks identified by our user groups I quickly drew this sketch that helped me pinpoint exactly which points in the process involved the most steps/ouside systems. This allowed us to develop custom APIs to those systems to help carry some of the information from one system to another.</p>

						<p class="hide centertext" id="show-on-click">This 'mental model' is the sketch I came up with to help clarify the API requirements.</p>
