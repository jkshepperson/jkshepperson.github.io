						<p class="centertext">In 2015, our sales teams expressed the need for a new dashboard to track and update their call metrics and daily lists. Poor visibility into call metrics was leading to poor call volume, duplicated work and loss of revenue...</p>

							<p class="centertext">To begin, I created and published a survey to 10 randomly selected participants, reflecting the ratio of our inbound and outbound sales teams. The goal was simple: understand their critical tasks, goals, frustrations and shortcuts to help us find the roots of the roadblocks.</p>

							<p class="centertext">Below is an example of an infographic I made to highlight the results of the survey for a board meeting with our CRM stakeholders.</p>

							<p class="centertext">Reviewing old research notes, making some quick phone calls and walking-through the tasks identified by our user groups I quickly drew this sketch that helped me pinpoint exactly which points in the process involved the most steps/ouside systems. This allowed us to develop custom APIs to those systems to help carry some of the information from one system to another.</p>
